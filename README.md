Wanted to generate a LED fading effect (fade-in and fade-out) for my upcoming video tutorial using the 555 timer IC.
I already have a video where I used LM358 Dual Operational Amplifier IC and another one with Arduino to generate the LED fading effect.

YouTube, is full of video showing how to generate the fading effect using 555 timer IC. However, none of them produce a true fading effect. 
Some just fades-in but never fades-out. And there is literally no explanation of how they are generating the fading effect other than just showing how to assemble the components.

In this tutorial, I am going to show you guys how to create a true LED fading effect using the 555 timer IC. I will also explain how the circuit works and how changing components change the fading effect of the LEDs.
